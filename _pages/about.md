<!-- I obtained my Master’s degree in Robotics, Systems, and Control at ETH Zurich. My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision, deep learning, and robotics, with a particular focus on enhancing the robustness of robotic perception systems in adverse conditions. -->

<!-- I am a master’s student in Robotics, Systems and Control at ETH Zurich, tutored by [Prof. Roland Siegwart](https://asl.ethz.ch/the-lab/people/person-detail.Mjk5ODE=.TGlzdC8yMDI4LDEyMDExMzk5Mjg=.html). My research interests lie in computer vision, particularly in dynamic scene handling, degraded image synthesis and restoration, and 3D scene reconstruction and understanding. -->
<!-- I am currently a Computer Vision & Machine Learning Research Intern at the Computer Vision Lab led by [Dr. Dengxin Dai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dengxin-dai-2412725a/?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Egoogle%2Ecom%2F&originalSubdomain=ch) at Huawei Zurich Research Center. Previously, I finished my master's thesis at  [Computer Vision and Geometry Group (CVG)](https://cvg.ethz.ch/) led by [Prof. Marc Pollefeys](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/marc.pollefeys/) on the topic of retrieval robust to object motion blur. I also conducted research on event-based vision at [Robotics and Perception Group (RPG)](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/index.html) led by [Prof. Davide Scaramuzza](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/people_scaramuzza.html). -->

I am currently a Research Assistant at the [Robotics and Perception Group (RPG)](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/index.html), under the supervision of [Prof. Davide Scaramuzza](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/people_scaramuzza.html). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision, deep learning, and robotics, with a particular focus on enhancing the robustness of robotic perception systems in adverse conditions.

I earned my Master’s degree **with distinction** in Robotics, Systems, and Control from [Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich (ETH Zurich)](https://ethz.ch/en.html). 

Prior to my Masters, I received my bachelor's degree **with distinction** in Engineering from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://english.hust.edu.cn/).
