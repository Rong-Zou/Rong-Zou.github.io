I am a master student majored in Robotics, Systems and Control at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), tutored by [Prof. Roland Siegwart](https://asl.ethz.ch/the-lab/people/person-detail.Mjk5ODE=.TGlzdC8yMDI4LDEyMDExMzk5Mjg=.html). My current research interests lie in the fields of computer vision, deep learning and robotics.
<!-- , with a primary objective being the enhancement of robotic intelligence, particularly in the context of perceptual capabilities, to address complex real-world challenges. -->

I am currently a Computer Vision Research Intern at Zurich Research Center, [Huawei Technologies Switzerland AG](https://www.huawei.com/ch-en/). Previously, I finished my master's thesis at  [Computer Vision and Geometry Group (CVG)](https://cvg.ethz.ch/) led by [Prof. Marc Pollefeys](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/marc.pollefeys/) on the topic of retrieval robust to object motion blur. I also conducted research on event-based vision at [Robotics and Perception Group (RPG)](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/index.html) led by [Prof. Davide Scaramuzza](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/people_scaramuzza.html).

Prior to my Masters, I received my bachelor's degree in Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://english.hust.edu.cn/).
